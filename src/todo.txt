1. Create an optimizer for the DCA settings.
    Optimizer will iterate through a large list of settings.
    Will try different combinations for.

2. Create a dynamic or static DCA: 
    a. dynamic DCA will be a percentage given for the base order and the safety order.
    b. use_all_cash boolean: Will use all available money on the placement of the final safety order in order to maximize profit.
    
    CHECK THIS WORKS BY ENTERING IN THE BASE ORDER PRICE AND SAFETY ORDER PRICE WITH THE REGULUAR DCA.
    DOUBLE CHECK BOTH OF THESE BY ENTERING IT INTO 3COMMAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
