1. Create an optimizer for the DCA settings.
    Optimizer will iterate through a large list of settings.
    Will try different combinations for.

Machine learning with DCA?
ML knows what settings to use depending on what market condition we are in (bull vs bear?)

Could there be a way to switch between DCA and lump sum investing?
    if we are above the 200MA, lump sum invest. Buy/Sell according to the hull moving average
    if we are below the 200MA DCA?

    what other indicators are there for a bull/bear market?
