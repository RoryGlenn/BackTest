1. Create an optimizer for the DCA settings.
    Optimizer will iterate through a large list of settings.
    Will try different combinations for.

2. Create a dynamic or static DCA: 
    a. dynamic DCA will be a percentage given for the base order and the safety order.
    b. use_all_cash boolean: Will use all available money on the placement of the final safety order in order to maximize profit.
    
    CHECK THIS WORKS BY ENTERING IN THE BASE ORDER PRICE AND SAFETY ORDER PRICE WITH THE REGULUAR DCA.
    DOUBLE CHECK BOTH OF THESE BY ENTERING IT INTO 3COMMAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!


3. PULL DATA FROM CRYPTO FUTURES TO SEE WHEN LIQUIDATION OCCURES

4. Time frames: Buy and hold might win out in the long run, but what time frames does DCA when out?


Machine learning with DCA?
ML knows what settings to use depending on what market condition we are in (bull vs bear?)

Could there be a way to switch between DCA and lump sum investing?
    if we are above the 200MA, lump sum invest. Buy/Sell according to the hull moving average
    if we are below the 200MA DCA?

    what other indicators are there for a bull/bear market?
